# Advent of Code 2023 
This is my first year doing [the Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! I'd heard about it while listening to [the 5th episode of Spotify's developer podcast, "Nerd Out"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2w8gnh8xh7cTAh5aYH1FML). It sounded fun, so I wanted to try! 

I'm going to try each of the puzzles using Python, since that's what I'm most comfortable with. Even though I've spent most of my 2023 honing my skills with AI chatbots & GitHub Copilot's autocomplete, I'm going to try and steer clear of using those tools, so as to challenge myself!

# Setting Up Environment
In order to run all of the code that I've written, you'll need to set up your environment! I've used [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management. 

Run the following code from the root of this repo: 

```
pip install poetry
poetry install --no-root
```

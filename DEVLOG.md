# **Devlog**
I want to keep a little logbook where I jot down some thoughts as I make my way through the Advent of Code! 

**December 2nd @ 1:00am -** Heyo! I'm just finishing the second puzzle. Around 11:30pm tonight, I realized that it was December and that the Advent of Code had started, so I figured I'd give it a shot! The first two puzzles were a decent bit of fun. I also like the website a *lot*. I especially fuck with [the little "personal leaderboard" bit](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/self) on the site. It's good stuff, and I'm excited to continue. 

**December 4th @ 11:45am -** It may just be that I'm getting into the swing of things, but I found that today's puzzle was really easy - I was able to breeze through it pretty quickly ðŸ’¨ I'm excited for them to get a little tougher! 

**December 5th @ 1:00pm -** Today's was the first that gave me a little trouble! I ended up solving it alright, but my code is a little inelegant and messy. I decided to check out the subreddit for the first time, and found [this post visualizing the flow of the numbers through all of the maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18bbswp/2023_day_5_part_2python_terminal_visualization/) - VERY cool stuff.

**December 6th @ 1:40pm -** After finishing today's puzzle (which was *quite* easy compared to yesterday), I decided to add a `time_per_day.json` file to my `data` folder. After each day's puzzle, I want to try and update this - that way, I'll have a running record of the time I spent on each puzzle, and won't need to calculate this once the challenge is over. 

**December 7th @ 9:00am -** I'm definitely getting into the spirit of things; as I'm completing a puzzle, I keep wondering "what's the best way to do something like this?" For today's puzzle, I'm sure that there's an easy math rule that I could've applied for Part 2 to understand the value of a hand if it had jokers. I'm excited to check out the Reddit after the fact to look at the solutions! 

I edited my TEMPLATE notebok today, since I realized that - as the puzzles get harder - it'll be helpful to have a "second" input file representing the smaller example case that's always included in the example. This way, I can check whether things work on the example before actually submitting the "real" answer. 

**December 9th @ 1:45pm -** Yesterday, while I was on a plane back home to NYC, I'd started Part 1 of Puzzle 8. The plane Wi-Fi was a little buggy, and I wasn't able to actually download Part 2; my timekeeping on stuff is a little off for sure. There was also a weird bug when submitting my answer, where it'd said I was wrong, but the site now says it was right. Whatever - I'll just move onto part 2 ðŸ˜‰

**December 12th @ 2:50am -** Just finished doing Day 11! I still haven't technically finished Day 10, since the flood fill aspect of things was harshing my mellow. Still, I wanted to keep my momentum going, so I just skipped it for now and moved onto Day 11's puzzle. I gotta say: I tried to go a lot slower with this one, and I was happy for it... BUT! I didn't go slowly enough at the beginning, apparently ðŸ˜… 

The entire 2 hours (which wasn't *entirely* focused on AoC, but mostly) for Part 1 could've been done in the 25min of Part 2 if I had thought of the problem as a projection problem. I instead spent a ton of time recreating arrays. If there's one thing about today's puzzle I want to stick with me, I'd like to remember: another 5-10 minutes thinking about the problem at the beginning can save you a lot of time! 

As a part of going slowly, I also spent some time writing out notes on a piece of paper. My secondary lesson of the day is: this has been immensely helpful for solving the problems, and I should do this again. 

Alright, enough rambling - it's 3:00am and I need sleep ðŸ˜´ Tonight was fun, though!

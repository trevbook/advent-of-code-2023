# **Devlog**
I want to keep a little logbook where I jot down some thoughts as I make my way through the Advent of Code! 

**December 2nd @ 1:00am -** Heyo! I'm just finishing the second puzzle. Around 11:30pm tonight, I realized that it was December and that the Advent of Code had started, so I figured I'd give it a shot! The first two puzzles were a decent bit of fun. I also like the website a *lot*. I especially fuck with [the little "personal leaderboard" bit](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/self) on the site. It's good stuff, and I'm excited to continue.
